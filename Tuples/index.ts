//A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.
// Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.

let tuple: [number, boolean, string];
tuple = [5, false, "Coding God was here"]; //order matters in our tuple

let v: [number, string] = [1, "2"];
console.log(v);
